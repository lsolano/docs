_**Note:** Some of these items are actually implemented in the latest release. We are in the process of reviewing all the specs in this section to determine what needs to be converted into actual documentation pages._
 
Specifications are descriptions of work we are doing or plan to do. They may vary in degree of specificity and the actual code may sometimes deviate from the spec as work progresses, without necessarily going back to change the spec. When the work is done, the spec is removed from the wiki or incorporated into a tech note as needed.
