This attribute is used inside a [[TestFixture|TestFixture-Attribute]]
to provide a common set of functions that are performed after each test method. 

TearDown methods may be either static or
instance methods and you may define more than one of them in a fixture.
Normally, multiple TearDown methods are only defined at different levels
of an inheritance hierarchy, as explained below.

So long as any SetUp method runs without error, the TearDown method is 
guaranteed to run. It will not run if a SetUp method fails or throws an 
exception.

#### Example:

```C#
namespace NUnit.Tests
{
  using System;
  using NUnit.Framework;

  [TestFixture]
  public class SuccessTests
  {
    [SetUp] public void Init()
    { /* ... */ }

    [TearDown] public void Cleanup()
    { /* ... */ }

    [Test] public void Add()
    { /* ... */ }
  }
}
```

#### Inheritance

The TearDown attribute is inherited from any base class. Therefore, if a base 
class has defined a TearDown method, that method will be called 
after each test method in the derived class. 
	
You may define a TearDown method
in the base class and another in the derived class. NUnit will call base
class TearDown methods after those in the derived classes.
   
#### Notes:

1. Although it is possible to define multiple TearDown methods
   in the same class, you should rarely do so. Unlike methods defined in
   separate classes in the inheritance hierarchy, the order in which they
   are executed is not guaranteed.

2. TearDown methods may be async if running under .NET 4.0 or higher.
