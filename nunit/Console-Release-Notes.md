#### NUnit Console 3.10 - March 24, 2019

This release merges the .NET Standard version of the engine back into the nunit.engine
NuGet package and adds a .NET Standard 2.0 version of the engine that re-enables most
services and extensions. This deprecates the `nunit.engine.netstandard` NuGet package.
Any test runners using the old .NET Standard version of the engine should switch to
this release.

The `--params` command line option which took multiple test parameters separated by
a semicolon is now deprecated in favor of the new `--testparam` command line option.
One of the most common uses for test parameters was to pass connection strings into
tests but this required workarounds to handle the semicolons. Now you must pass in
each test paramater separately using a `--testparam` or `--tp` option for each.

#### NUnit Console 3.9 - September 5, 2018

This release should stop the dreaded SocketException problem on shutdown. The
console also no longer returns -5 when AppDomains fail to unload at the end of a
test run. These fixes should make CI runs much more stable and predictible.

For developers working on the NUnit Console and Engine project, Visual Studio
2017 update 5 or newer is now required to compile on the command line. This does
not effect developers using NUnit or the NUnit Console, both of which support building
and running your tests in any IDE and on any .NET Framework back to .NET 2.0.
