The **Author** Attribute adds information about the author of the tests. It can be applied to test fixtures and to tests.

The constructor takes the name of the test author and optionally the author's email address. Author can also be specified on
a TestFixture or Test attribute.

```C#
[TestFixture]
[Author("Jane Doe", "jane.doe@example.com")]
[Author("Another Developer", "email@example.com")]
public class MyTests
{
 [Test]
 public void Test1() { /* ... */ }

 [Test]
 [Author("Joe Developer")]
 [Author("Yet Another Developer", "not.my.email@example.com")]
 public void Test2() { /* ... */ }
}

[TestFixture(Author = "Jane Doe")]
public class MyOtherTests
{
 [Test]
 public void Test1() { /* ... */ }

 [Test(Author = "Joe Developer")]
 public void Test2() { /* ... */ }
}
```

**Note:** From NUnit version 3.7  you can have multiple Author attributes per fixture or test. Before version 3.7 you could only have one Author attribute  per fixture or test.
